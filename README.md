**Myanmar Agricultural Report Power BI Project**

**Project Overview**

This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of Myanmar's agricultural sector, focusing on crop values, growth trends, and regional agricultural contributions. The report is divided into three main sections: Overview, Crop, and State_City.

**Dashboards & Visuals**

1. **Overview Dashboard**
   - **Slicer**: Allows filtering by region.
   - **KPI Cards**: Displays key metrics, including acres value and city.
   - **Donut Chart**: Represents the crop value distribution across different agricultural products.
   - **Stacked Column Chart**: Shows agricultural value by state region.
   - **Table**: Lists state regions with their corresponding crop values, including paddy, sesame, green gram, urad pea, ground-nut, pigeon pea, maize, sunflower, cotton, and sugar-cane.

2. **Crop Dashboard**
   - **Slicer**: Filters data by crop type.
   - **Pie Charts**: Displays crop data including value, growth rate, target, and market share.
   - **Stacked Bar Chart**: Visualizes the sum of crop values across different categories.
   - **Stacked Bar Chart**: Compares the sum of crop values with growth rates.
   - **KPI Cards**: Displays target value with 10% growth rate, highest value crop, and least value crop.
   - **Table**: Shows crop name, value, average value, and growth rate for each crop.

3. **State_City Dashboard**
   - **Table**: Lists state regions and the corresponding agricultural values for crops such as cotton, green gram, ground-nut, maize, paddy, pigeon pea, sesame, sugar-cane, sunflower, and urad pea, along with the total value.
   - **Treemap**: Provides a breakdown of total agricultural value by state region.
   - **Clustered Column Chart & Clustered Bar Chart**: Compares average agricultural values by region and city.

**Navigation & User Interaction**

The dashboards are interactive with slicers for filtering by region, crop type, and other variables. Users can explore different aspects of Myanmar's agricultural sector, from regional performance to individual crop growth and value trends.

**Insights & Findings**

- **Regional Agricultural Trends**: Analyze agricultural value distribution across various regions and states.
- **Crop Performance**: Understand the performance of different crops, including their value, growth rate, market share, and targets.
- **State-City Analysis**: Gain insights into agricultural values at the state and city levels, identifying key areas for growth and investment.
  
**Conclusion**

This Power BI project offers a comprehensive overview of Myanmar's agricultural sector, providing valuable insights into crop values, growth trends, and regional performance. By visualizing key metrics and agricultural data, the report supports informed decision-making for stakeholders in the agricultural industry.
